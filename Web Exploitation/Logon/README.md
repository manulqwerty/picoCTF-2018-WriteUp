## Question
>I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. http://2018shell.picoctf.com:62746 (link) 

### Hint
>Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for admins?\nHow does check the admin's password?

## Solution
The index is a login that we can bypass with a simple SQLi:
```
username : admin' or '1'='1
password : pass
```
The succesful login directs us to `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:62746/flag` where we see `No flag for you`
To get the flag we need to set the Admin Cookie to True.
